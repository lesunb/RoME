## <i class="fas fa-scroll" style="color:var(--theme-color)"></i> Description

The International Summer School on Robotic Mission Engineering (RoME) aims to promote the engineering of missions of robotic applications through systematic approaches of Software Engineering. This year, RoME is funded by ACM Sigsoft. In its second edition, we will have four days event full of presentations, working sessions, lots of discussions and opportunities to engage on very interesting research topics.  
 
The expected outcomes of this summer school are to:

(i) promote the dissemination of scientific research and its practical application regarding the engineering of autonomous robotic missions through systematic approaches to Software Engineering;

(ii) promote technological innovation by sharing with the community of professors and university students both within UnB and other teaching institutions in Computing and similar in the Federal District,

(iii) attract students to contribute to the development of the proposed research and

(iv) foster the internationalization of research excellence through scientific collaboration between our research group and international academic centers of excellence.

RoME will take place at the University of Brasília, from February 20th to February 23rd, 2024. For more information contact [us](mailto:romesummerschool@gmail.com).
